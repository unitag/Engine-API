TODO: introduction

```javascript
{
    url: Resolver | [Resolver],
    state: String,
    label: String,
    needs: String | [String],
    input: Input | [Input],
    entryPoints: {Step},
    index: Step
}
```

Field | Description | Markup
------|-------------|-------
`url` | Describes how this operation can be reached. Can be a single value or an array, but always returned as an array. See the [Resolver](#the-resolver-object) object for more details. | No
`state` | Describes the publication state of this operation. Possible values are `NOT_PUBLISHED`, `PUBLISHED`, `UNPUBLISHED` and `BLOCKED`. The `PUBLISHED` and `UNPUBLISHED` states can be written, the others are read-only. | No
`label` | Defines an arbitrary name for this operation (generated by default). | No
`needs` | Defines the environment values needed by this operation. TODO: more details needed here. | No
`inputs` | Defines which data is needed globally for this operation. Can be a single value or an array. See the [Input](#the-input-object) object for more details. | No
`entryPoints` | Defines the set of routes implemented by this operation. Each key in the object defines an URL-path, to which is associated an arbitrary processing. See the [Step](#the-step-object) object for more details. | No
`index` | Stands as a shortcut for `entryPoints.index`. This is because the `index` step has a special meaning: it is the default step, which is accessed when no URL path is specified. | No
